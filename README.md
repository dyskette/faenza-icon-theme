---------------------

These are the sources directly from the last release 1.3. 

I will fix missing symlinks for new software versions, but is difficult for me to add new icons because I'm not a designer. Help is appreciated.

TODO
----

- Add method to build all themes reliably.
- Add style guidelines.
